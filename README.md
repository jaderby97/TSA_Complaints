# TSA_Complaints
This project analyzes **complaint data submitted to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)** to understand how complaint types and volumes changed over time and across airports.  
The analysis highlights operational trends, passenger experience issues, and the impact of procedural changes within TSA.

## Project Overview
The goal was to visualize and interpret patterns in TSA complaints from airports around the U.S. and abroad.  
By combining time-series and geographic analysis, this project identifies when and where significant shifts in complaint behavior occurred.

Key steps included:
- Cleaning and preparing TSA complaint data  
- Categorizing complaint types and summarizing frequency over time  
- Building **time-series plots** to visualize complaint trends  
- Creating **geographical heatmaps** to show complaint density by airport or region  
- Linking observable patterns to known TSA procedural changes  

## Results & Insights
- Complaint volumes fluctuated significantly around major TSA policy updates and global events.  
- Heatmaps revealed regional clusters of recurring complaint types.  
- Clear visual evidence shows how operational or staffing changes correlated with improved or worsened passenger feedback.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- plotly or folium (for mapping)  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Time-series and geospatial visualization  
- Data storytelling and communication of operational insights  
- Python data manipulation and plotting  

## Repository Structure
- `TSA Complaints.ipynb` – main analysis notebook  
- `complaints-by-airport.csv`, 'complaints-by-category.csv', 'iata-icao.csv – raw complaint data
